Brow Boy Beat em Up Engine (BBBEU Engine) is a game engine created with javascript for creating web based 2D games.

All code is open sourced and free to use without warranty for both commercial and non-commercial projects.

If you use this code for your own projects credit is not required but would be grateful if you could leave a mention for 
David Whiteford and Paul O'Callaghan and a link to this github repositry.


BBBEU Engine is built from the ground up for a specific purpose and may need a lot of tweaking to run on your own games.
